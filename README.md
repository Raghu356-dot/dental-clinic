# 🦷 Dental Clinic Website

A **static dental clinic website** built using **HTML, CSS, and images** to showcase dental services, treatments, and clinic information.

This project provides a responsive, visually appealing front-end web presence for a dental clinic — perfect for learning, customization, or demo purposes.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a simple **static website** that displays information about dental treatments, services, and clinic features.

Visitors can browse service sections such as:

* Dental procedures (Implants, Tooth Filling, Root Canal, etc.)
* Cosmetic treatments (Bleaching, Veneer, Pediatric dentistry)
* Clinic facilities and staff
* Contact or About pages (if added)

There is **no backend server or database** — it is intended to be deployed as a static site.
